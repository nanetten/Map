This is Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree's 5th project, Neighborhood Map. 

In this project I used:
- Google maps api https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/?hl=es-419
- Knockout for viewmodel http://knockoutjs.com
- Flickr api to load photos https://www.flickr.com/services/api
- a bit of Jquery here and there https://jquery.com

1. SETUP 

  1.1 First you need to download all the files. You can do this manually by clicking on "Clone or download" > "Download Zip". You can also       clone the files with GitHub, refer to https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository for more information.

  1.2 After you have downloaded all the files, you can run this app by opening index.html with a browser.
